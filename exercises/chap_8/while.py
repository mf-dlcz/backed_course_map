WHILE

Complete the regenerate function using a while loop. It takes current_health, max_health and enemy_distance integers and returns an integer.

1. Use a while loop to determine if they can regenerate. Assume they're stationary and enemies are pursuing them. The character can regenerate while both of these conditions are true:

    - The character's current_health is less than their max_health.

    - An enemy is more than a distance of 3 from the character.

2. For each iteration of the loop:

    - The character gains 1 health.

    - The enemy_distance shortens by 2.

3. Return the new current_health after regeneration stops.
